## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Feature	       Agile	                                        Waterfall
Approach:	Iterative & flexible;	                              Sequential & structured
Planning:	Continuous & adaptive;	                            Fixed upfront planning
Flexibility:	Highly adaptable to changes	Rigid;              difficult to change
Testing:	Ongoing throughout development;	                    Done at the end of the project
Customer Involvement:	High, frequent feedback	Low;            only at milestones
Delivery:	Frequent releases in sprints;	                      Single final release

Advantages & Disadvantages of Agile
Advantages:

- User Testing & Feedback – Real users help identify usability issues.
- Documentation & Standards – Clear guidelines ensure consistency and maintainability.

Why Maintaining High Standards is Important
- Reduces costly bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- Enhances user satisfaction and trust.
- Improves maintainability and scalability of software.
- Ensures compliance with industry regulations.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining Project Scope & Its Contribution to Successful Planning
Defining the project scope sets clear boundaries, objectives, and deliverables, helping prevent scope creep, manage resources efficiently, and ensure stakeholder alignment. It provides a roadmap for project execution and avoids misunderstandings.

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.

Why is WBS Useful?
Enhances clarity by breaking complex projects into structured components.
Improves task assignment and resource allocation.
Helps track progress and manage risks effectively.
Ensures accurate cost estimation and time management.

A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that displays tasks, timelines, and dependencies. It helps by:

Providing a Clear Timeline – Shows task durations and deadlines.
Tracking Progress – Updates task completion in real time.
Managing Dependencies – Identifies relationships between tasks.
Enhancing Communication – Keeps teams and stakeholders aligned.
